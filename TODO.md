#in progress: least_cost_matrix.R
convert least_cost_matrix to cost_matrix_cpp


#conversion to C++
distance functions
distance matrix function


#workflow steps once data is ready
- distance matrix
  - distance_metrics.cpp
  - distance_matrix.cpp

#functions to remove?
distance.R
distanceMatrix.R (maybe refactor it to write matrices to disk instead?)
