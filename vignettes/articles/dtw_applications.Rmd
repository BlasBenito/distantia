# Summary

This article lists interesting applications of dynamic time warping I have found in the literature, patents, and other resources. It is supposed to be a living document, so it will be updated from time to time with new findings.

## Industry

### Wearables

[**Wave ring**](https://genkiinstruments.com/products/wave) a MIDI controller to create music [patented by Genki](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220085841A1/en).

### Manufacturing

[**LAMTSS**](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/technology/corporate/rdc/rd/topics/20/2006-01.html), by Toshiba, for prediction and detection of operational failures in heavy machinery.

### Software

[**Sift**](https://wiki.has-motion.com/doku.php?id=sift:sift_overview) software, by [HAS Motion](https://www.has-motion.ca/), [uses DTW](https://wiki.has-motion.com/doku.php?id=sift:dynamic_time_warping:dynamic_time_warping) to find anomalies in large biomechanics datasets
