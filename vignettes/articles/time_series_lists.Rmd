### Manipulating TSLs

This section only covers a few of the data-manipulation capabilities of `distantia`.

#### Aggregation

The function `tsl_aggregate()` applies an aggregation function to specific time frames. For example, the code below computes the maximum temperature per year

```{r}
tsl_temp <- tsl_aggregate(
  tsl = tsl,
  new_time = "year",
  method = max
)

tsl_plot(
  tsl = tsl_temp[1:5],
  ylim = "relative"
)
```
Same as above, but by decade.

```{r}
tsl_temp <- tsl_aggregate(
  tsl = tsl,
  new_time = "decades",
  method = max
)

tsl_plot(
  tsl = tsl_temp[1:5],
  ylim = "relative"
)
```
