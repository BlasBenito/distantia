Title: Computation of Dissimilarity Between Multivariate Time Series
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Blas M. Benito
Maintainer: Blas M. Benito <blasbenito@gmail.com>
Description: This R package provides tools to assess the dissimilarity between multivariate time series by using the psi measure described in "Numerical methods in Quaternary pollen analysis" (Birks and Gordon, 1985 <doi:10.1002/jqs.3390020110>). The algorithm computes a matrix of distances (euclidean, manhattan, chi) between all sample pairs, and minimizes the sum of distances while respecting the sample order.
