\title{Computes sum of distances between consecutive samples in a multivariate time-series.}
\usage{
psi(
  least.cost = NULL,
  autosum = NULL,
  parallel.execution = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{least.cost}{character string, name of the column with time/depth/rank data. The data in this column is not modified.}

\item{autosum}{dataframe with one or several multivariate time-series identified by a grouping column.}

\item{parallel.execution}{boolean, if \code{TRUE} (default), execution is parallelized, and serialized if \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with named slots, each one with a psi value.
}
\description{
Computes the sum of distances between consecutive samples in a multivariate time-series. Required to compute the measure of dissimilarity \code{psi} (Birks and Gordon 1985). Distances can be computed through the methods "manhattan", "euclidean", "chi", and "hellinger", and are implemented in the function \code{\link{distance}}.
}
\details{
The measure of dissimilarity \code{psi} is computed as: \code{least.cost - (autosum of sequences)) / autosum of sequences}. It has a lower limit at 0, while there is no upper limit.
