\title{Splits Multivariate Time Series List into Univariate}
\usage{
tsl_split(tsl = NULL, sep = "__")
}
\arguments{
\item{tsl}{(required, list) Time series list. Default: NULL}

\item{sep}{(required, character string) separator between the time series name and the column name.}
}
\value{
Time series list
}
\description{
This function takes a time series list with multivariate zoo objects to generate a new one with univariate zoo objects. A time series list with the the zoo objects "A" and "B", each with the columns "a", "b", and "c", becomes a time series list with the zoo objects "A__a", "A__b", "A__c", "B__a", "B__b", and "B__c". The only column of each new zoo object is named "x".
