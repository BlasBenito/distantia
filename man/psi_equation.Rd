\usage{
psi_equation(a = NULL, b = NULL, diagonal = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{(required, numeric) Result of \code{\link[=psi_cost_path_sum]{psi_cost_path_sum()}}, the sum of distances of the least cost path between two time series. Default: NULL}

\item{b}{(required, numeric) Result of \code{\link[=psi_auto_sum]{psi_auto_sum()}}, the cumulative sum of the consecutive cases of two time series. Default: NULL}

\item{diagonal}{(optional, logical) Used to correct the computation of \code{psi} when diagonals are used during the computation of the least cost path. If the cost matrix and least cost path were computed using \code{diagonal = TRUE}, this argument should be \code{TRUE} as well. Default: TRUE}

\description{
Demonstration function to computes the \code{psi} dissimilarity score (Birks and Gordon 1985). Psi is computed as \eqn{\psi = (2a / b) - 1}, where \eqn{a} is the sum of distances between the relevant samples of two time series, and \eqn{b} is the cumulative sum of distances between consecutive samples in the two time series.

If \code{a} is computed with dynamic time warping, and diagonals are used in the computation of the least cost path, then one is added to the result of the equation above.
