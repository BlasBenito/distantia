## Warning

Version 2.0.0 of `distantia` is a full re-write of the original package and **will break existing workflows** before **making them better**. Please refer to the [Changelog](https://blasbenito.github.io/distantia/news/index.html) for details before updating.

## Summary

The R package **`distantia`** offers an efficient, feature-rich toolkit for managing, comparing, and analyzing time series data. It is designed to handle a wide range of scenarios, including:

- Multivariate or univariate time series.
- Regular or irregular sampling. 
- Time series of different lengths.

### Key Features

#### Comprehensive Analytical Tools

  - 10 distance metrics: see `distantia::distances`.
  - The normalized dissimilarity metric `psi`.
  - Three Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods for shape-based comparisons.
  - A Lock-Step method for sample-to-sample alignment.
  - Restricted permutation tests for robust inferential support.
  - Variable Importance Analysis: assessment of contribution to dissimilarity of individual variables in multivariate time series.
  - Hierarchical and K-means clustering of time series based on dissimilarity matrices.
  
#### Computational Efficiency

  - A **C++ back-end** powered by [Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org/).
  - **Parallel processing** managed through the [future](https://future.futureverse.org/) package.
  - **Efficient data handling** via [zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html).

#### Time Series Management Tools

  - Introduces **time series lists (`tsl`)**, a versatile format for handling collections of time series stored as lists of `zoo` objects.
  - Includes a suite of `tsl_...()` functions for generating, resampling, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing both univariate and multivariate time series.

## Install

The package `distantia` can be installed from CRAN.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("distantia")
```


The development version can be installed from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  repo = "blasbenito/distantia", 
  ref = "development"
  )
```

## Getting Started

This section showcases several features of the package `distantia`. Please, check the **Articles** section for further details.

### Setup

All heavy duty functions in `distantia` now support a parallelization backend and progress bars.

```{r packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(distantia)
library(future)
library(parallelly)

#parallelization setup
future::plan(
  future::multisession,
  workers = parallelly::availableCores() - 1
  )

#progress bar (does not work in Rmarkdown)
#progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)
```

### Example Data

The `albatross` data frame contains daily GPS data of 4 individuals of Waved Albatross in the Pacific captured during the summer of 2008. Below are the first 10 rows of this data frame:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
albatross |> 
  distantia::utils_drop_geometry() |> 
  head()
```

The `albatross` data is converted to *Time Series List* with `tsl_initialize()`, and scaled and centered with `tsl_transform()` and `f_scale`, to facilitate shape-based comparisons and variable importance analyses.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4.5, out.width = "100%"}
tsl <- tsl_initialize(
  x = albatross,
  name_column = "name",
  time_column = "time",
  lock_step = TRUE
) |> 
  tsl_transform(
    f = f_scale
  )

tsl_plot(
  tsl = tsl,
  ylim = "relative"
)
```

### Dissimilarity Analysis

#### Lock-Step Analysis

Lock-step analysis performs direct sample-to-sample comparisons without time distortion. It requires time series of the same length, observed at the same times.

```{r}
df_ls <- distantia(
  tsl = tsl,
  lock_step = TRUE
)

df_ls[, c("x", "y", "psi")]
```

The "psi" column contains normalized dissimilarity values and is used to sort the data frame from lowest to highest dissimilarity (the first row shows the most similar time series).

The function `distantia_boxplot()` helps quickly identify time series that are either more dissimilar (top) or similar (bottom) to others.

```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3, out.width = "75%"}
distantia_boxplot(df = df_ls)
```

#### Dynamic Time Warping

By default, the function `distantia()` calculates the dissimilarity between pairs of time series using dynamic time warping (DTW) with weighted diagonals by default. This approach is useful for time series shifted due to factors such as varying phenology, asynchronous behavior, or non-overlapping sampling periods.

```{r}
df_dtw <- distantia(
  tsl = tsl
)

df_dtw[, c("x", "y", "psi")]
```

The function `distantia_plot()` provides detailed insights into the alignment between a pair of time series resulting from DTW.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, out.width = "100%"}
distantia_plot(
  tsl = tsl[c("X132", "X153")]
)
```

Deviations from the perfect diagonal in the least-cost path reveal adjustments made by DTW to align time series by shape rather than time. Vertical or horizontal segments indicate one sample of a time series is matched with multiple samples of another.

### Permutation Test

`distantia` implements restricted permutation tests to assess the significance of dissimilarity scores, supporting various configurations based on data assumptions.

For example, the configuration below rearranges complete rows within 7-day blocks, assuming strong dependencies within rows and between observations close in time.

```{r}
df_dtw <- distantia(
  tsl = tsl,
  repetitions = 1000,
  permutation = "restricted_by_row",
  block_size = 7
)

df_dtw[, c("x", "y", "psi", "p_value")]
```

The "p_value" column represents the fraction of permutations yielding a psi score lower than the observed value. It indicates the strength of similarity between two time series. A significance threshold (e.g., 0.05, depending on iterations) helps identify strongly similar or dissimilar pairs. 

### Variable Importance

When comparing multivariate time series, certain variables contribute more to similarity or dissimilarity. The `distantia_importance()` function uses a leave-one-out algorithm to quantify each variable's contribution.

```{r}
df_importance <- distantia_importance(
  tsl = tsl
)

df_importance[, c("x", "y", "variable", "importance", "effect")]
```

Positive "importance" values indicate variables increasing differences between time series, while negative values indicate variables enhancing similarity. The function documentation provides more details on how importance scores are computed.

The `distantia_boxplot()` function can provide insights into which variables contribute the most to similarity or dissimilarity.

```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3, out.width = "75%"}
distantia_boxplot(
  df = df_importance
)
```

### Clustering

`distantia` provides tools for grouping time series by dissimilarity using hierarchical clustering or k-means. 

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5, out.width = "75%"}
dtw_hclust <- distantia_cluster_hclust(
  df = df_dtw,
  clusters = NULL, #automatic mode
  method = NULL    #automatic mode
  )

#cluster object
dtw_hclust$cluster_object

#number of clusters
dtw_hclust$clusters

#clustering data frame
#group label in column "cluster"
#negatives in column "silhouette_width" higlight anomalous cluster assignation
dtw_hclust$df

#tree plot
par(mar=c(3,1,1,3))

plot(
  x = stats::as.dendrogram(
    dtw_hclust$cluster_object
    ),
  horiz = TRUE
)
```
