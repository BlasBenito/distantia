## Warning

Version 2.0.0 of `distantia` is a full re-write from scratch and **will break existing workflows**. Please refer to the Changelog for details before updating.

## Summary

The `distantia` package has undergone a major overhaul to enhance both performance and usability. Core functions are now implemented in C++ for faster execution and improved memory efficiency, with streamlined R wrappers to simplify user interaction. 

Function and argument names have been updated to follow modern conventions, offering a more intuitive experience. Additionally, most time series operations are now powered by the [zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html) library, providing consistent data handling and computational efficiency.

Version 2.0 introduces the concept of "time series lists" (`tsl`), using lists of zoo objects to manage and organize time series data. A full suite of functions prefixed with `tsl_...()` allows users to easily generate, resample, transform, analyze, and visualize univariate, multivariate, regular, or irregular time series. Many of these functions support parallel execution via the [future](https://future.futureverse.org/) package, with progress indicators provided by [progressr](https://progressr.futureverse.org/) for a smoother user experience. 

Finally, to further aid learning and experimentation, new example datasets and tools for generating simulated time series are also included.
