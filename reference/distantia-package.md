# distantia: A Toolset for Time Series Dissimilarity Analysis

Fast C++ implementation of Dynamic Time Warping for time series
dissimilarity analysis, with applications in environmental monitoring
and sensor data analysis, climate science, signal processing and pattern
recognition, and financial data analysis. Built upon the ideas presented
in Benito and Birks (2020) <doi:doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04895>, provides
tools for analyzing time series of varying lengths and structures,
including irregular multivariate time series. Key features include
individual variable contribution analysis, restricted permutation tests
for statistical significance, and imputation of missing data via GAMs.
Additionally, the package provides an ample set of tools to prepare and
manage time series data.
