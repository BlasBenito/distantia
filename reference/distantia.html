Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) finds the optimal alignment between two time series by minimizing the cumulative distance between their samples. It applies dynamic programming to identify the least-cost path through a distance matrix between all pairs of samples. The resulting sum of distances along the least cost path is a metric of time series similarity. DTW disregards the exact timing of samples and focuses on their order and pattern similarity between time series, making it suitable for comparing both regular and irregular time series of the same or different lengths, such as phenological data from different latitudes or elevations, time series from various years or periods, and movement trajectories like migration paths. Additionally, distantia() implements constrained DTW via Itakura Parallelograms with the bandwidth argument, which defines a region around the distance matrix diagonal to restrict the spread of the least cost path.
Lock-step (LS) sums pairwise distances between samples in regular or irregular time series of the same length, preferably captured at the same times. This method is an alternative to dynamic time warping when the goal is to assess the synchronicity of two time series.
The psi score normalizes the cumulative sum of distances between two time series by the cumulative sum of distances between their consecutive samples to generate a comparable dissimilarity score. If for two time series \(x\) and \(y\) \(D_xy\) represents the cumulative sum of distances between them, either resulting from dynamic time warping or the lock-step method, and \(S_xy\) represents the cumulative sum of distances of their consecutive samples, then the psi score can be computed in two ways depending on the scenario:
Equation 1: \(\psi = \frac{D_{xy} - S_{xy}}{S_{xy}}\)
Equation 2: \(\psi = \frac{D_{xy} - S_{xy}}{S_{xy}} + 1\)
When $D_xy$ is computed via dynamic time warping ignoring the distance matrix diagonals (diagonal = FALSE), then Equation 1 is used. On the other hand, if $D_xy$ results from the lock-step method (lock_step = TRUE), or from dynamic time warping considering diagonals (diagonal = TRUE), then Equation 2 is used instead:
In both equations, a psi score of zero indicates maximum similarity.
Permutation methods are provided here to help assess the robustness of observed psi scores by direct comparison with a null distribution of psi scores resulting from randomized versions of the compared time series. The fraction of null scores smaller than the observed score is returned as a p_value in the function output and interpreted as "the probability of finding a higher similarity (lower psi score) by chance".
In essence, restricted permutation is useful to answer the question "how robust is the similarity between two time series?"
Four different permutation methods are available:
"restricted": Separates the data into blocks of contiguous rows, and re-shuffles data points randomly within these blocks, independently by row and column. Applied when the data is structured in blocks that should be preserved during permutations (e.g., "seasons", "years", "decades", etc) and the columns represent independent variables.
"restricted_by_row": Separates the data into blocks of contiguous rows, and re-shuffles complete rows within these blocks. This method is suitable for cases where the data is organized into blocks as described above, but columns represent interdependent data (e.g., rows represent percentages or proportions), and maintaining the relationships between data within each row is important.
"free": Randomly re-shuffles data points across the entire time series, independently by row and column. This method is useful for loosely structured time series where data independence is assumed. When the data exhibits a strong temporal structure, this approach may lead to an overestimation of the robustness of dissimilarity scores.
"free_by_row": Randomly re-shuffles complete rows across the entire time series. This method is useful for loosely structured time series where dependency between columns is assumed (e.g., rows represent percentages or proportions). This method has the same drawbacks as the "free" method, when the data exhibits a strong temporal structure.


This function allows computing dissimilarity between pairs of time series using different combinations of arguments at once. For example, when the argument distance is set to c("euclidean", "manhattan"), the output data frame will show two dissimilarity scores for each pair of time series, one based on euclidean distances, and another based on manhattan distances. The same happens for most other parameters.
This function supports a parallelization setup via future::plan(), and progress bars provided by the package progressr. However, due to the high performance of the C++ backend, parallelization might only result in efficiency gains when running permutation tests with large number of iterations, or working with very long time series.'><meta property="og:description" content='This function combines dynamic time warping or lock-step comparison with the psi dissimilarity score and permutation methods to assess dissimilarity between pairs time series or any other sort of data composed of events ordered across a relevant dimension.
