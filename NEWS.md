## Version 1.0.1

Fixed a bug in the function **workflowImportance**. The argument 'exclude.columns' was being ignored.

Fixed the documentation of the functions **workflowImportance** and **workflowSlotting**. Their outputs were not well documented.

Fixed an error in workflowTransfer.

Changed how psi is computed. It's now more respectful with the original formulation, and handles very similar sequences better.

## Version 1.0.0 is ready!
