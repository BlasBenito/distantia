    description: "This paper introduces 'distantia', an R package to assess dissimilarity between regular or irregular, univariate or multivariate time-series"

- title: Naming Conventions
  desc: |
      The package follows these naming conventions:

        - `tsl_...()`: functions to generate, process, and explore time series lists (TSLs).
        - `zoo_...()`: functions to work with zoo time series.
        - `distantia_...()`: functions to compare time series via dynamic time warping or lock-step methods.
        - `psi_...()`: step-by-step demonstration of how psi dissimilarity scores are computed.
        - `utils_...()`: internal functions and helpers.
        - `f_...()`: transformation functions used as input arguments for other functions.
        - `..._cpp()`: C++ functions built via [Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) for efficient dissimilarity analysis.
